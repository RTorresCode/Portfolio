 ## ABOUT ME
 
My name is Ramon, and I'm extremely passionate about software and technology!

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from CUNY - Hunter College in **June 2022**.

I taught myself how to program starting with HTML over 6 years ago, and am always looking to learn new programming languages and/or frameworks.

Some of my hobbies are video games (I'm a big fan of RPGs), playing the Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game (both physical and digital), listening to music (I want to learn to play the drums one day), and cooking (not a big fan of baking).

I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, so I always have something that I'm trying to learn, or improve at.

Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn, GitHub, or E-mail me directly. All of my contact links can be found underneath my picture.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy your stay!

\- Ramon
