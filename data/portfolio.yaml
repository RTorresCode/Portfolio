        description: 'A photography portfolio website that I developed for a client. Created using the MERN technology stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Has full pagination features, as well as a search feature that searches by photo name or by tag(s). Dynamic components were created using Material UI, and React-Redux was used for state management. RESTful API has full CRUD functionality.'
